<Section type="overview" title="Project Description">

TechBank Solutions needed to modernize their mobile banking app to compete with fintech startups. The existing app had poor user ratings and low engagement, with customers frequently abandoning transactions midway through the process.

### Project Goals
- Simplify the account overview and transaction flow
- Improve accessibility and usability for all age groups
- Reduce customer support calls related to app confusion
- Increase daily active users and transaction completion rates

## User Research & Analysis
### Understanding Banking Behaviors

I conducted user interviews with 25 existing customers across different age groups to understand their banking habits and pain points. The research revealed that users were overwhelmed by the number of options on the home screen and struggled to find basic functions like transfer money or check balance.

## Design Solutions
### Streamlined Information Architecture

I redesigned the app's information architecture to prioritize the most common tasks. The new design features a simplified home screen with quick actions, improved navigation patterns, and clearer visual hierarchy throughout the app.

## Visual Design
### Modern Interface with Enhanced Accessibility

The visual design focused on creating a trustworthy, modern interface that would appeal to both younger and older users. I implemented a larger font system, improved color contrast, and simplified iconography throughout the app.
