# Overview

Acme Corporation needed a modern, intuitive project management solution that could handle complex workflows while remaining accessible to all team members. The existing system was outdated and causing significant productivity losses.

## Key Highlights
- Increased team productivity by 40%
- Reduced onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days
- Achieved 95% user satisfaction rating

# Context

The project management landscape was evolving rapidly, with teams becoming more distributed and workflows more complex. Acme's existing solution was built for a different era of work.

## Challenges
- Complex workflows needed to be simplified without losing functionality
- Diverse user base required an intuitive interface that worked for both power users and novices
- Legacy system integration required careful consideration of data migration
- Mobile-first approach needed to support remote work
