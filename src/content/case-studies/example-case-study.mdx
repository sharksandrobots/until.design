# Context

The project management landscape was evolving rapidly, with teams becoming more distributed and workflows more complex. Acme's existing solution was built for a different era of work.

### Challenges
- Complex workflows needed to be simplified without losing functionality
- Diverse user base required an intuitive interface that worked for both power users and novices
- Legacy system integration required careful consideration of data migration
- Mobile-first approach needed to support remote work

# The Work

## Research & Discovery
### Understanding the Problem Space

We began with extensive user research, interviewing over 50 project managers and team members across different industries. This helped us identify key pain points and opportunities for improvement.

### Understanding the Problem Space

Our design process focused on creating a flexible system that could adapt to different team needs while maintaining consistency and usability. We started with low-fidelity wireframes and gradually increased fidelity as we validated our solutions.
