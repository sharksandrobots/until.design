      Our design process focused on creating a flexible system that could adapt to different team needs while maintaining consistency and usability. We started with low-fidelity wireframes and gradually increased fidelity as we validated our solutions.

      Throughout the process, we maintained close collaboration with stakeholders and end users. Regular feedback sessions helped us identify pain points early and iterate quickly on potential solutions. This iterative approach allowed us to refine the interface while ensuring it remained intuitive and efficient.

      The final design system we developed was both comprehensive and flexible. It included a robust component library, clear documentation, and guidelines for implementation. This foundation enabled teams to build consistent experiences while maintaining the flexibility needed for different use cases.
