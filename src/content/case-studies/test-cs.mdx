<Section type="overview" title="Overview">

This is a test case study to make sure our MDX setup is working properly and to test all image grid configurations.

### Key Points
- MDX is rendering
- Components are working
- Layout looks good

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="3-3">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-3.jpg" 
    alt="3-3 Layout test 1"
    caption="3-3 Layout: Image 1 (3 columns)"
  />
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-4.jpg" 
    alt="3-3 Layout test 2"
    caption="3-3 Layout: Image 2 (3 columns)"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<ImageGrid layout="text-left-2-4">
  <div>TEXT CONTENT HERE</div>
  <div>IMAGE CONTENT HERE</div>
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="context" title="Context">

Testing the full-width layout configuration.

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="full">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-1.jpg" 
    alt="Full width test"
    caption="Full Layout: Single image spanning all 6 columns"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="work" title="The Work">

## Testing 2-4 Layout
This should show first image taking 2 columns, second taking 4 columns.

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="2-4">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-3.jpg" 
    alt="2-4 Layout test 1"
    caption="2-4 Layout: Image 1 (2 columns)"
  />
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-4.jpg" 
    alt="2-4 Layout test 2"
    caption="2-4 Layout: Image 2 (4 columns)"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="work" title="">

## Testing 4-2 Layout
This should show first image taking 4 columns, second taking 2 columns.

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="4-2">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-3.jpg" 
    alt="4-2 Layout test 1"
    caption="4-2 Layout: Image 1 (4 columns)"
  />
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-4.jpg" 
    alt="4-2 Layout test 2"
    caption="4-2 Layout: Image 2 (2 columns)"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="work" title="">

## Testing 5-1 Layout
Image takes 5fr, caption takes 1fr (like 4-2 layout but with caption instead of second image).

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="5-1">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-1.jpg" 
    alt="5-1 Layout test"
    caption="This caption is hidden"
  />
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-2.jpg" 
    alt="This image is hidden"
    caption="5-1 Layout: This caption appears in the right column (1fr) while the image is in the left column (5fr)"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="work" title="">

## Testing 1-5 Layout
Caption takes 1fr, image takes 5fr.

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="1-5">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-2.jpg" 
    alt="This image is hidden"
    caption="1-5 Layout: This caption appears in the left column (1fr)"
  />
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-1.jpg" 
    alt="1-5 Layout test"
    caption="This caption is hidden"
  />
</ImageGrid>

<Section type="work" title="">

## Testing text-left-2-4 Layout
Text content on left (1fr), image on right (2fr).

    ### Research Insights
    Our user research revealed several key findings that shaped our design decisions:
    
    - Users struggled with the complex navigation structure
    - Loading times were consistently too slow for mobile users
    - The interface felt cluttered and overwhelming
    - Key features were buried too deep in the menu hierarchy
    
    These insights directly informed our redesign approach.

## Testing text-right-4-2 Layout
Image on left (2fr), text content on right (1fr).

</Section>

<ImageGrid layout="text-right-4-2">
  <Image 
    src="/img/example-3.jpg" 
    alt="Design process wireframes"
    caption="Early wireframes exploring different layout approaches"
  />
  <TextContent>
    ### Design Process
    We started with low-fidelity wireframes to explore different approaches to the information architecture problem.
    
    The process involved:
    - Sketching initial concepts
    - Creating digital wireframes
    - Testing with users
    - Iterating based on feedback
    
    This iterative approach allowed us to validate our ideas early and often.
